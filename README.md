## Abstract

The Vacuum Torque Engine v2 is the core experimental proposal of the Topology & Entanglement Theory (TET-CVTL). It employs coherent phonons generated by surface acoustic waves (SAW) in advanced magnetoelastic heterostructures to parametrically amplify topological torque from the primordial trefoil vacuum lattice ($L_k=6$).

This repository contains the full paper, device architecture, numerical simulations, quantitative predictions, and multi-scale implications spanning cosmology, energy extraction, quantum biology, and embodied consciousness.

## Key Features

- Detailed multilayer architecture (piezoelectric, magnetostrictive, ISHE readout)
- Extended numerical simulations calibrated on real materials (FeGa, FeCoSiB, LiNbO$_3$)
- Quantitative predictions: resonance 420–580 MHz, ISHE voltage 100–600 μV/W, topological threshold $\epsilon_c \approx 7.2 \times 10^{-4}$
- Multi-scale applications: from primordial knot braiding to Orch-OR synchronization
